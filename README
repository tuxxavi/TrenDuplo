# Duplo Train Remote

## Project Description
The **Duplo Train Remote** is an Arduino-based project that provides a graphical interface to control a LEGO Duplo train. Utilizing the LVGL library, the user interface includes various controls such as sliders for adjusting speed, buttons for controlling lights and horn sounds, and indicators for monitoring train status. The remote connects to the train via Bluetooth and controls the motor speed, lights, and various sound effects.

## Installation
To set up the project on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/duplo-train-remote.git
    cd duplo-train-remote
    ```

2. Install the required libraries in your Arduino environment:

    - [LVGL](https://github.com/lvgl/lvgl)
